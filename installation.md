# Installation

### **Installation**

Navigate to your root folder **`(ex. materially-react-hook-material-js)`**

c:\>cd materially-react-hook-material-js
```

Install Packages by **npm.**

```bash

```

### Start

After package installation, you can start your app by using **`npm run start`** command

```bash
c:\materially-react-hook-material-js> npm run start
```

This will start your local server at **`http://localhost:3000`** Also, your terminal shows the following.

To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

### Build & Deploy

This might be too early to deploy but it is always good to know how to deploy.

To build your app in production use **`npm run build`** command

```javascript
c:\materially-react-hook-material-js> npm run build
```

### Deploy for your live site

Change the base URL with your domain and build your application.

You can control this with the `homepage` field in your **`package.json`**

{% code title="package.json" %}
```javascript
"homepage": "http://example.com"
```
{% endcode %}
